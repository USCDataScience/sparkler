   A web crawler is a bot program that fetches resources from the web for the sake of building applications like search engines, knowledge bases, etc. Sparkler (contraction of Spark-Crawler) is a new web crawler that makes use of recent advancements in distributed computing and information retrieval domains by conglomerating various Apache projects like Spark, Kafka, Lucene/Solr, Tika, and Felix. Sparkler is an extensible, highly scalable, and high-performance web crawler that is an evolution of Apache Nutch and runs on Apache Spark Cluster.
