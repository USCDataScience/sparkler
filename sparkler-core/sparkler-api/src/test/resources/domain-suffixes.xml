  Description: This document contains top level domains
  as described by the Internet Assigned Numbers
  Authotiry (IANA), and second or third level domains that
  are known to be managed by domain registerers. People at
  Mozilla community call these public suffixes or effective
  tlds. There is no algorithmic way of knowing whether a suffix
  is a public domain suffix, or not. So this large file is used
  for this purpose. The entries in the file is used to find the
  domain of a url, which may not the same thing as the host of
  the url. For example for "http://lucene.apache.org/nutch" the
  hostname is lucene.apache.org, however the domain name for this
  url would be apache.org. Domain names can be quite handy for
  statistical analysis, and fighting against spam.

  The list of TLDs is constructed from IANA, and the
  list of "effective tlds" are constructed from Wikipedia,
  http://wiki.mozilla.org/TLD_List, and http://publicsuffix.org/
  The list may not include all the suffixes, but some
  effort has been spent to make it comprehensive. Please forward
  any improvements for this list to nutch-dev mailing list, or
  nutch JIRA.

  Top level domains(tlds) are grouped
  to three, namely infrastrusture, generic and country
  code tlds. Infrastrusture tlds are only used for
  technical reasons. Generic tlds represents the type
  of the organization that they represent. Those in
  current use and those waiting for approval is listed.
  Most of the country code tlds correspond to the two
  letter ISO-3166-1 country codes.
  Each tld is listed with its domain (such as com), a
  status enumeration describing the status of the tld,
  and optionally a description or description for convenience.
  cctlds are listed with additional country name field.

  status and boost elements are optional, with default values IN_USE
  and 1.0 respectively. see domain-suffixes.xsd for the xml schema.

                    vrsn-end-of-zone-marker-dummy-record.root is a domain name
                    listed in the DNS root zone as a diagnostic marker, whose
                    presence demonstrates the root zone was not truncated upon
                    loading by a root nameserver. It could be argued it represents
                    a top-level domain of .root, although technically no such
                    delegation exists.

                    (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.arpa) .arpa is an Internet
                    top-level domain (TLD) used exclusively for
                    Internet-infrastructure purposes. It does not function as a
                    normal TLD where websites are registered, but rather as a
                    meta-TLD used to look up addresses, and for other purposes.
